<h3> CI-CD Pipelines using Github Actions</h2>
<h5>
Using github's feature that is the github actions the workflows can be automated.<br>
In this program I've used github actions to automante the test process, os compatibility, and much more.<br>
Using the github/workflows I've created a basic CI-CD workflow that you can see above.<br>
The aim of the project is to understand the core concepts of CI-CD and learn the basic concepts in it.
